# CoffeTime
Software for automating the operation of a coffee shop. It includes the functions of order management, product accounting, menu planning, sales analysis and personnel management.
Main functions:
– Automatic order formation based on customer preferences and availability of products.
– Accounting of goods balances and procurement planning.
– The ability to create individual and seasonal offers.
– Sales analytics and recommendations for improving the menu.
– Personnel management: accounting of working hours, distribution of tasks, quality control of service.
– The possibility of online ordering.
– Mobile application for customers with the ability to track the order, evaluation and quality.
This application is suitable for any coffee shop, the owners or managers of the coffee shop will be able to create their own account, upload a photo of the coffee shop itself and a menu with photos for each coffee or dessert so that the customers can order or choose before they come to the coffee shop.
There will also be only online payment, and a receipt will be sent to your personal account so that there are no misunderstandings.
The only negative that I see is getting a database to start the project.

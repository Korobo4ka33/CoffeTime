# CoffeTime
Software for automating the operation of a coffee shop. This application gives you the opportunity to come to a coffee shop and immediately pick up your coffee without waiting for its preparation. 
 The app will search for the nearest coffee shop.
Main functions:
– Automatic order formation based on customer preferences and availability of products.
– The possibility of online ordering for a certain time.
– A mobile application for customers with the ability to track the order, evaluation and quality.
This application is suitable for any coffee shop, the owners or managers of the coffee shop will be able to create their own account, upload a photo of the coffee shop itself and a menu with photos for each coffee or dessert so that the customers can order or choose before they come to the coffee shop.
I also understand that there will be fake orders for which no one will come, so the client will pay immediately during the pre-order, it is no longer possible to cancel the order after the barista has started making coffee.
 -the application allows you to save time for customers and they are more loyal to the coffee shop.
 -the application allows you to increase the number of customers by expanding the "coffee with you" method, the more customers, the greater the profit. 
 -the barista will see the order and will be able to see the amount of sugar or the temperature of milk without discussing with the visitor everything will be indicated in the order, this reduces the load on the barista during rush hour.
 -customers will have feedback from the coffee shop that will help fix problems. 
 The order is considered completed if the coffee shop has confirmed it, so the barista will receive notifications about the pre-order. The application will be free so that it will be viral, the developers' profit will be services that coffee shops can use to promote 
 The only negative that I see is getting a database to start the project.
